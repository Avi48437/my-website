I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Washington University in St. Louis.  
My academic training is in statistics, with a strong foundation in probability theory, statistical inference, and high-dimensional methods.

I completed my Master of Statistics (M.Stat) and Bachelor of Statistics (B.Stat) degrees at the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata, where I specialized in probability and statistical theory. During my graduate studies at ISI, I worked on several research projects spanning high-dimensional classification, network models, and time series analysis, combining methodological development with theoretical analysis and simulation studies.

My research experience includes work on exact feature screening methods for ultrahigh-dimensional binary classification, where I developed improved Kolmogorov–Smirnov based screening procedures, including bootstrap-assisted jackknife methods and correlation-based pre-screening strategies. I have also studied dynamic stochastic block models with node- and edge-level temporal evolution, extending classical static models to dynamic multi-block settings and developing associated estimators with theoretical guarantees. In applied settings, I have collaborated on the statistical analysis of long-term river water quality data, using time-series modeling, nonparametric trend tests, and multivariate techniques to construct interpretable water-quality indices.

Broadly, my research interests lie in the development and analysis of modern statistical methodology motivated by high-dimensional and structured data. I am particularly interested in problems that require a combination of probabilistic tools, asymptotic theory, and computational techniques.
